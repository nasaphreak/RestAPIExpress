# Server

This folder contains the express API project,
I used mongoose to connect to a mongoDB database.

This is a sample of a Login System, where checks the database if username and password matches.

# This isn't a secure App

The Username and password is sent as a Plain text from the client to the API, so be carefull.

I did all of this Application while studying Web Development.
